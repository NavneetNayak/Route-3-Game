# Route-3-GameDevelopment-Competition
I participated in a game development competition on behalf of my school and I honestly don't remember the name of the competition ðŸ˜“. The game we made is called Route-3

The game is called Route-3 because you can explore the same level in three different routes based on the character you play as. If you play as "Fire" you can jump and dash as normal but you die as soon as you touch the water (obviously). If you play the level as "Water" then you can't breath on the surface but you can swim infinetly in the water, opening up a new way to explore the level. If you play as "Air" then you can jump and dash mush farther, allowing you to explore the level through higher platforms that couldn't be reached by "Fire" or "Water". 

For now the game has only one level and is more so a proof of concept, I think the core Idea of the game is great and this gameplay mechanic of exploring the same level in different ways based on the character you play as can be used to make amazing new levels not to mention more characters can be made that could explore levels in different ways!! The possibilities are endless.
